## Introduction

ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Statement:** ExtendedUse, a clothing company focusing on sustainability through recycled materials, lacks a dedicated website, relying solely on third-party platforms like Shopify and Instagram for sales. Building a bespoke website for ExtendedUse presents an opportunity to enhance brand visibility and customer experience while gaining hands-on full-stack development experience.

This project encapsulates the fusion of entrepreneurship and technology, aiming to empower ExtendedUse with a digital platform that mirrors its commitment to sustainability and innovation.

## Risks and Challenges

Throughout the project, several risks and challenges were encountered, each requiring strategic mitigation to ensure successful project completion:

1. **Technical Complexity:**
   - **Risk:** Integrating new technologies such as React and the Stripe API posed challenges due to their learning curve and implementation complexities.
   - **Mitigation:** Dedicated time for research, online tutorials, and breaking down complex tasks into manageable components facilitated gradual proficiency in the new technologies.

2. **Time Constraints:**
   - **Risk:** Managing time effectively as a solo developer posed challenges in meeting project deadlines.
   - **Mitigation:** Agile principles were adopted to prioritize tasks, track progress efficiently, and adjust timelines as needed. Scope was carefully managed to ensure alignment with available resources and project objectives.

3. **Resource Limitations:**
   - **Risk:** Limited access to hardware, software, and external support impacted project execution.
   - **Mitigation:** Optimization of available tools, leveraging open-source software, and active engagement with online resources and communities helped overcome resource constraints. Collaboration with peers and mentors provided valuable guidance and support.

4. **Cost Constraints:**
   - **Risk:** Budget limitations affected procurement of necessary resources and tools required for project development.
   - **Mitigation:** Careful budget planning and prioritization of essential expenditures ensured optimal utilization of available funds. Open-source solutions and free development environments, such as GitHub for version control and Visual Studio Code for code editing, were leveraged to minimize costs. Additionally, online forums, documentation, and tutorials provided valuable learning resources at no cost.

By adopting proactive risk management strategies and leveraging free resources effectively, these challenges were successfully addressed, contributing to the overall success of the project.

## Outstanding Issues

While the project has reached a significant milestone and achieved its primary objectives, there are still several outstanding issues and areas for improvement that require attention:

1. **Insufficient Product Catalog:**
   - The current product catalog may be limited in size or variety, potentially limiting the overall appeal and functionality of the application. Expanding the product catalog with a wider range of offerings can enhance user engagement and satisfaction.

2. **Deployment Pending:**
   - The application has yet to be deployed to a production environment, limiting its accessibility and usability to users. Deploying the application to Azure, a reliable cloud hosting provider, is essential for making it accessible to a wider audience.

3. **Image Upload Functionality for Developers:**
   - The absence of image upload functionality for developers/admins hinders the ability to showcase products effectively within the application. Implementing a feature that allows developers/admins to upload images for products can enrich the user experience and enhance the visual appeal of the catalog.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Despite efforts to optimize performance, there may still be opportunities to further enhance the application's speed and responsiveness, particularly during peak usage periods or when handling large volumes of data.

5. **User Experience Enhancements:**
   - Continuous feedback from users may reveal areas where the user experience can be improved, such as streamlining navigation, enhancing accessibility, or refining visual elements to better align with user preferences.

6. **Security Enhancements:**
   - Ongoing vigilance is required to ensure the application remains resilient to security threats and vulnerabilities. Regular security audits and updates may be necessary to address emerging risks and protect user data.

7. **Scalability Considerations:**
   - As user traffic and data volume increase over time, scalability may become a concern. Evaluating the application's architecture and infrastructure to ensure it can handle growth effectively is essential for long-term sustainability.

8. **Documentation and Maintenance:**
   - Comprehensive documentation and clear code organization are crucial for facilitating future maintenance and updates to the application. Investing time in documenting key components, APIs, and deployment processes can streamline future development efforts.

By addressing these outstanding issues and implementing necessary improvements, the project can continue to evolve and enhance its functionality, ultimately providing greater value to its users and stakeholders.
